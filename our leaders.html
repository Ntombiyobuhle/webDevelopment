        <h1 style="background-color:palegoldenrod;padding: auto"><center>OUR LEADERS</center></h1>
        <p style="background-color:palegoldenrod;padding:9%">KYP employs a team of 20 young adults, most of whom grew up in Kliptown and understand the challenges faced by our members. We take pride in having a dedicated and enthusiastic staff who view their roles not just as jobs but as opportunities to contribute to and effect positive change in their community.

            Our organization operates with a relatively flat structure. While individual responsibilities are assigned, major decisions about the organization's future are made collaboratively by the team.
            
            Staff development is a crucial aspect of our organization. Ninety percent of our staff members have engaged in professional development, with many completing multiple courses and three earning degrees with KYP’s support. Each member of the management team receives guidance and support from a mentor.
            
            A key part of our mission is to prepare young staff members for careers beyond KYP. Several former staff members have moved on to higher-paying jobs, serving as examples of success for current KYP members. We also focus on retaining our core team of key staff who possess the essential skills and knowledge needed for the effective operation of the organization.</p>
